# Algorithmic complexity
Considering the flexibility on the numbers of borrowers and lenders, I would choose Option B (n*log(m)). 
I think the time to find the right match is according to the input size and logarithmic time does not depend on the numbers
. I would expect the time size would decrease significantly in each iteration.
